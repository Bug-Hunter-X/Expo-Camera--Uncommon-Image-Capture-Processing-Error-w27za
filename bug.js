This error occurs when using Expo's `Camera` API with specific image formats or when there are issues with permissions or file access.  The error message itself might not be very descriptive, often pointing to a general failure in the image capture or processing pipeline.  Debugging requires careful examination of permissions, file paths, and the image format being used.
