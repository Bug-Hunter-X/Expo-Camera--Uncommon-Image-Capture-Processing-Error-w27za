# Expo Camera: Uncommon Image Capture/Processing Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using Expo's Camera API. The error is characterized by a lack of specific error messaging, making it difficult to diagnose. The problem likely stems from issues with permissions, file system access, or incompatibility with certain image formats.

## Problem Description

The core issue involves image capture failures with the Expo Camera API.  The app may crash or simply fail to capture an image without providing a clear error message beyond a generic failure indication. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking and handling permissions, ensuring correct file paths, and verifying compatibility with supported image formats.  This example provides improved error handling and input validation to enhance robustness.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `expo start`
4. Attempt to capture an image, potentially using an unsupported format or modifying permissions to trigger the error.
